## Introduction

**Superscribe is a free and open-source data platform for headless content management**. It can be installed on top of any
new or existing SQL database, instantly providing a dynamic API (REST+GraphQL) and accompanying App for managing
content. Built entirely in TypeScript (in Node and Vue), Superscribe is completely modular and end-to-end extensible...
with absolutely no paywalls or artificial limitations.

Modern and intuitive, the Superscribe App enables no-code data discovery, allowing for even the most non-technical users to
view, author, and manage your raw database content. Our performant and flexible API is able to adapt to any relational
schema, and includes rule-based permissions, event/web hooks, custom endpoints, numerous auth options, configurable
storage adapters, and much more.

Current database support includes: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MS-SQL Server, OracleDB, MariaDB, and variants such as AWS
Aurora/Redshift or Google Cloud Platform SQL.

## Installing

Superscribe requires NodeJS 10+. Create a new project with our simple CLI tool:

The above command will create a directory with your project name, then walk you through the database configuration and
creation of your first admin user.
