You may decide to share one of the Items within the collection with an individual or group of individuals who don&#39;t yet have permission. In this case, use Shares. Shares let you give anybody access to an Item. When you create a Share on an Item, a Role for the Share to inherit view permissions is assigned. Then you can share the Item via a hyperlink or email. The link leads to a page containing the read-only content for just that shared Item.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Read-only</p><p>At this time, Shares are read-only.

If you are an <code>Administrator</code>, <em>congratulations!</em> You can share any Item you want. However, Users with other Roles will likely have limited Share permissions.</p><p>Any Share will inherit the same read permissions as the Role it was associated with in the Share Options Menu.</p><p>This system allows for absolutely granular configuration options on Shares... <em>but it also means you&#39;ll need to understand <a href="/configuration/users-roles-permissions.html">Users, Roles, and Permissions</a> thoroughly to use Shares properly</em>. Here are some highlights of what you can do:</p><ul><li>Set the Collections a Role can view or share.</li><li>Filter for specific Items a Role can view or share.</li><li>Set specific Fields a Role can view or share.</li><li>Set view permissions of relationally linked Items.</li><li>Restrict Role access to specific IP address(es).</li></ul><h2 id="is-data-sharing-safe" tabindex="-1">Is Data Sharing Safe? <a class="header-anchor" href="#is-data-sharing-safe" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Is Data Sharing Safe?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Obviously, you don&#39;t want to expose Items unless they are explicitly shared, however some Items may be linked to Items in other Collections. So, in addition to inheriting the Role&#39;s permissions, the API automatically generates and injects a permissions set so that only the shared Item <em>(and the Items relationally linked to that shared Item)</em> can be viewed. As noted previously, viewability is dependent on whether the Role associated to the Share has read permissions on those linked Collections.</p><h2 id="assigning-a-role" tabindex="-1">Assigning a Role <a class="header-anchor" href="#assigning-a-role" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Assigning a Role&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The Role option in the <a href="#share-options-menu">Share Options Menu</a> lets you associate a Role to the Share.
