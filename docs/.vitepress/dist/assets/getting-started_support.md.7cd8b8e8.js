Directus has been built specifically for wrapping <em>relational</em> databases. While we could force Mongo to use tables, columns, and rows via Mongoose object modeling, that approach of &quot;faking&quot; a relational structure in a non-structured environment like Mongo doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense.
