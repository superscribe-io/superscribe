However, you may have noticed that each operation in a flow executes just one time. Because of this, you can&#39;t create a &quot;for-loop&quot; within the operations of a single flow.</p><p>However, to achieve a &quot;for-loop&quot;, you can instead use the <a href="/configuration/flows/operations.html#trigger-flow">trigger flow</a> operation to pass the data into an <a href="/configuration/flows/triggers.html#another-flow">another flow</a> trigger. When this type of trigger receives an array as a Payload, the flow runs for each item in the array individually.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p><p>Remember: for some use-cases, you can also iterate through data in a <a href="/configuration/flows/operations.html#run-script">Run Script</a> operation.</p></div><h2 id="the-recipe" tabindex="-1">The Recipe <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-recipe" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;The Recipe&quot;">‚Äã</a></h2><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Requirements</p><p>You&#39;ll need a flow with an array of data on its data chain.</p></div><h3 id="configure-the-starting-flow" tabindex="-1">Configure the Starting Flow <a class="header-anchor" href="#configure-the-starting-flow" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Configure the Starting Flow&quot;">‚Äã</a></h3><ol><li>Configure a <a href="/configuration/flows.html#configure-a-flow">flow</a> a <a href="/configuration/flows/operations.html#trigger-flow">trigger flow</a> operation.</li><li>Under <strong>Payload</strong>, be sure to add the desired array.</li><li>Save and exit the flow.</li></ol><h3 id="configure-the-for-loop-flow" tabindex="-1">Configure the &quot;For-Loop&quot; Flow <a class="header-anchor" href="#configure-the-for-loop-flow" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Configure the &quot;For-Loop&quot; Flow&quot;">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Once your starting flow is configured as desired, follow these steps.</p><ol><li><a href="/configuration/flows.html#create-a-flow">Create a flow</a> using the <a href="/configuration/flows/triggers.html#another-flow">another flow</a> trigger.</li><li><a href="/configuration/flows.html#configure-an-operation">Configure operations</a> as desired.</li></ol><h2 id="final-tips" tabindex="-1">Final Tips <a class="header-anchor" href="#final-tips" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Final Tips&quot;">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Once your for-loop is configured, you can process the data several ways.</p><p>First, you could simple let the &quot;for-loop&quot; flow process each element in the <strong>Payload</strong>.</p><p>Second, you could also configure a <strong>Response Body</strong> in the trigger of your &quot;for-loop&quot; flow.

If you do this, just keep API performance in mind. If you configure a <strong>Response Body</strong>, the parent flow will halt execution until it receives <strong>Response Body</strong>.</p><p>Good luck and have fun! üßë‚Äçüç≥</p>',17);function d(e,g,w,m,y,_){return l(),i("div",null,[f,o("blockquote",null,[o("p",null,t(e.$frontmatter.description),1)]),o("div",h,[o("p",c,"Author: "+t(e.$frontmatter.author),1),o("p",null,[u,a(" "+t(e.$frontmatter.directus_version),1)])]),p])}const v=r(s,[["render",d]]);export{b as __pageData,v as default};
