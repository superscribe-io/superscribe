Each collection represents a <strong>table</strong> in your database. By default, the <a href="#title-formatter">title formatter</a> is used to display any existing database table names as human-readable collection titles. There are also &quot;folder&quot; collections that are <a href="/configuration/data-model.html#sorting-grouping">exclusively used for organizational purposes</a>, and don&#39;t hold any data themselves.</p><p>Collections can be organized in any way that is appropriate for your project. You can architect them platform-specific (e.g., <em>pages</em> of a website), or in a more platform-agnostic way (e.g., raw <em>customers</em> of your business). While there&#39;s no right or wrong way to structure your data-model, we recommend keeping your data as agnostic as possible so it is easier to repurpose in the future. <strong>In short, learn to see your data as its own asset — not only through the lens of your immediate project needs</strong>.</p><p>The only requirement of a collection is that it must contain a <a href="#primary-key-pk">Primary Key</a> field.

Each vendor has subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) differences in how they function, so Directus includes an abstraction layer that helps it avoid writing different code for each type.</p><p>This means there is also the possibility of supporting other datastores in the future, such as NoSQL options like MongoDB, or even third-party data services like Firebase or Heroku. However these options are <em>fundamentally</em> different from the relational SQL databases we currently support, and so more research is needed.</p><h2 id="displays" tabindex="-1">Displays <a class="header-anchor" href="#displays" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Displays&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Displays are the smaller, read-only counterpart to <a href="#interfaces">Interfaces</a>, defining how a field&#39;s data will be displayed inline throughout the App.</p><p>For example, you may have a &quot;Status&quot; field that uses a <em>Dropdown</em> Interface on the Item Detail page, and a smaller <em>Badge</em> Display when the field is referenced throughout the rest of the App. Directus includes many Displays out-of-the-box, below are the some key examples:</p><ul><li><strong>Raw</strong> — The exact value, straight from the API</li><li><strong>Formatted Value</strong> — Provides options for string formatting</li><li><strong>Boolean</strong> — Customizable True/False icons</li><li><strong>Color</strong> — A color swatch preview</li><li><strong>DateTime</strong> — Formatted or relative datetimes</li><li><strong>Image</strong> — Thumbnail previews</li><li><strong>Labels</strong> — Small, custom colored badges</li><li><strong>Rating</strong> — Customizable stars</li><li><strong>Related Values</strong> — Displays relational display titles</li><li><strong>User</strong> — Avatar and name of a system user</li></ul><p>In addition to the included core displays, custom displays allow for creating new and/or proprietary ways to view or represent field data.

Each field represents a <strong>column</strong> in your database. For example, an <code>articles</code> <a href="#collections">Collection</a> might have <code>title</code>, <code>body</code>, <code>author</code>, and <code>date_published</code> field. Fields mirror the characteristics of their associated column, including its <code>name</code>, <code>type</code>, <code>default</code>, <code>length</code>, <code>allow_null</code>, etc.</p><h3 id="relevant-guides-2" tabindex="-1">Relevant Guides <a class="header-anchor" href="#relevant-guides-2" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Relevant Guides&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><a href="/reference/system/fields.html#creating-a-field">Creating a Field</a></li><li><a href="/reference/system/fields.html#duplicating-a-field">Duplicating Fields</a></li><li><a href="/reference/system/fields.html#adjusting-field-layout">Adjusting Field Layout</a></li><li><a href="/reference/system/fields.html#deleting-a-field">Deleting Fields</a></li></ul><h2 id="files-assets" tabindex="-1">Files &amp; Assets <a class="header-anchor" href="#files-assets" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Files &amp; Assets&quot;">​</a></h2><p>As you might have guessed, files includes images, videos, PDFs, text documents, or anything else. While files can technically be stored as code in the database, it is far more common to manage them as individual assets on a &quot;drive&quot;. The platform supports many options for uploading, storing, transforming, and retrieving different types of files, and it is an excellent Digital Asset Management system.</p><h2 id="icons" tabindex="-1">Icons <a class="header-anchor" href="#icons" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Icons&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="material-icons" tabindex="-1">Material Icons <a class="header-anchor" href="#material-icons" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Material Icons&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Full list of icons <a href="https://fonts.google.com/icons" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">can be found here</a>.

Examples include text inputs, toggles, WYSIWYG editors, dropdowns, sliders, image galleries, and more.</p><p>In addition to the many core interfaces included out-of-the-box, <em>custom</em> interfaces allow for creating more tailored or proprietary options, such as seating charts, QR codes, or Stripe customer info.</p><h3 id="relevant-guides-3" tabindex="-1">Relevant Guides <a class="header-anchor" href="#relevant-guides-3" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Relevant Guides&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><a href="/extensions/interfaces.html">Creating a Custom Interface</a></li></ul><h2 id="items" tabindex="-1">Items <a class="header-anchor" href="#items" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Items&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Items are objects within a Collection which contain values for one or more fields. Each collection represents a <strong>record</strong> in your database.</p><p>Items are the primary building blocks of your project content. Similar to a &quot;row&quot; within a spreadsheet, all data within the platform is accessed via these &quot;atomic&quot; data units. Items themselves are fairly straightforward, however their real power comes from the complexity that begins to form when items are relationally connected to each other.</p><p>Items are referenced (both individually and relationally) by their unique <a href="#primary-key-pk">primary key</a>.</p><h4 id="relevant-guides-4" tabindex="-1">Relevant Guides <a class="header-anchor" href="#relevant-guides-4" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Relevant Guides&quot;">​</a></h4><ul><li><a href="/app/content/items.html#create-an-item">Creating an Item</a></li><li><a href="/app/content/items.html#archive-an-item">Archiving an Item</a></li><li><a href="/app/content/collections.html#manually-sort-items">Manually Sorting Items</a></li><li><a href="/app/content/items.html#delete-an-item">Deleting an Item</a></li></ul><h2 id="junction-collections" tabindex="-1">Junction Collections <a class="header-anchor" href="#junction-collections" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Junction Collections&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The platform allows you to group Items within different Collections. But often times it is important to &quot;link&quot; items across different collections (such as relating <code>recipes</code> and <code>ingredients</code>) — this is called a relationship. There are several different types of relationships, but only some (M2M and M2A) require an additional collection to properly connect data. For instance, if you have a <code>recipes</code> collection and an <code>ingredients</code> collection, you would also need a <code>recipe_ingredients</code> junction collection to sit between and connect the two.</p><h2 id="layouts" tabindex="-1">Layouts <a class="header-anchor" href="#layouts" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Layouts&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Layouts determine how you view or interact with a Collection. In most cases, they offer a way to browse items based on a specific type of data, but can also be used to visualize or interact with data. Directus includes several Layout options out-of-the-box, each with different features and configuration options.</p><ul><li><strong>Table</strong> — Works with any type of data, showing items as rows and their fields as columns.</li><li><strong>Cards</strong> — Ideal for image data, this layout shows items as a grid of image cards.</li><li><strong>Calendar</strong> — Ideal for &quot;temporal&quot; data that is sorted by date or datetime.</li><li><strong>Map</strong> — Ideal for &quot;geospatial&quot; data that is shown on a world map.</li></ul><p>In addition to these core layouts, custom layouts allow for creating more tailored or proprietary ways to experience data within the App, such as Gantt charts, seating maps, or spreadsheets.</p><h3 id="relevant-guides-5" tabindex="-1">Relevant Guides <a class="header-anchor" href="#relevant-guides-5" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Relevant Guides&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><a href="/extensions/layouts.html">Creating a Custom Layout</a></li></ul><h2 id="modules" tabindex="-1">Modules <a class="header-anchor" href="#modules" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Modules&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Modules are the highest and broadest level of organization within the App. There are several modules included out-of-the-box, however you can also add your own.</p><p>The <a href="/app/overview.html#_1-module-bar">Module Bar</a> lists all available Modules and allows you to switch between them. Each module also controls its own navigation bar to provide tailored access to sub-pages.

There are two main ways to achieve multitenancy:</p><ul><li><strong>Project Scoping</strong> — Creating a super-admin layer that provisions new tenant projects has been made easier by the Cloud-native model of Directus 9+. This method involves developing custom code that can dynamically spin up/down projects, but is also the most flexible, supporting scoped extensions and differentiated project settings.</li><li><strong>Role Scoping</strong> — In this method, you create one Role per tenant, and configure their permissions to properly scope them within a single project. This direction allows for tenants to share a single schema using <em>item</em> scoped permissions, or different schemas by using <em>collection</em> scoped permissions.</li></ul><h2 id="panels" tabindex="-1">Panels <a class="header-anchor" href="#panels" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Panels&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Panels are modular units of data visualization that exist within the <a href="/app/insights.html">Insights module</a>.

Much like an address for a house, the primary key field provides the location of an item within its collection. For that reason, every collection must have a primary key field, and so they are configured when you create the collection. There are different types of identifiers you can use, but the field is often called <code>id</code>.</p><h2 id="projects" tabindex="-1">Projects <a class="header-anchor" href="#projects" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Projects&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A Project is a complete instance of the platform.

But often times it is important to &quot;link&quot; items across different collections (such as relating <code>recipes</code> and <code>ingredients</code>) — this is called a relationship, a crucial concept within any <em>relational</em> database. There are several different types of relationships, each serving a specific purpose. <a href="/configuration/data-model/relationships.html">Learn more about Relationships</a>.</p><h2 id="revisions" tabindex="-1">Revisions <a class="header-anchor" href="#revisions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Revisions&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Revisions are created whenever an Item is updated. These alternate versions are tracked so that previous states can be recovered. Every change made to items in Directus is stored as a complete versioned snapshot and a set of specific changes made (the delta). The revisions system is tightly coupled to the activity logs system, with each revision linked to the activity event where it was created.</p><h2 id="roles" tabindex="-1">Roles <a class="header-anchor" href="#roles" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Roles&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Roles define a specific set of access permissions, and are the primary organizational structure for Users within the platform. You can create an unlimited number of roles, so organize your users in whatever way feels most appropriate.</p><p>During the installation process, Directus automatically creates an &quot;Administrators&quot; Role, which is used to provide the initial admin user with full platform access. However this is just a <em>normal</em> role, and so it can still be updated, renamed, or even deleted. Keep in mind that your project must maintain at least one role with Admin Access at all times.</p><p>There is also a &quot;Public&quot; role that determines access for unauthenticated access.</p><h3 id="relevant-guides-9" tabindex="-1">Relevant Guides <a class="header-anchor" href="#relevant-guides-9" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Relevant Guides&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li><a href="/configuration/users-roles-permissions.html#creating-a-role">Creating a Role</a></li><li><a href="/configuration/users-roles-permissions.html#configure-a-role">Configuring a Role</a></li><li><a href="/configuration/users-roles-permissions.html#configure-permissions">Configuring Role Permissions</a></li><li><a href="/configuration/users-roles-permissions.html#configure-system-permissions">Configuring System Permissions</a></li><li><a href="/configuration/users-roles-permissions.html#deleting-a-role">Deleting a Role</a></li></ul><h2 id="singleton" tabindex="-1">Singleton <a class="header-anchor" href="#singleton" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Singleton&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><strong>Directus</strong> - A collection that only contains one single item</li><li><a href="https://www.patterns.dev/posts/singleton-pattern/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>Design pattern</strong></a> - Classes which can be instantiated once and can be accessed globally.

Anyone can add or refine any languages through the integration with <a href="https://locales.directus.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Crowdin</a>.</p><p>In addition to the App itself being multilingual, the platform allows translating your schema too. By default, collections and field names come from the database&#39;s naming, but you can override this in different languages.</p><p>The platform also includes different ways to manage multilingual content. The built-in translation interface supports authoring content in any number of languages, side-by-side reference editing, and mixing in language agnostic content (such as dates or toggles).</p><h2 id="types" tabindex="-1">Types <a class="header-anchor" href="#types" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Types&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The &quot;type&quot; defines how field content is stored in the database and how it is returned by the API.
