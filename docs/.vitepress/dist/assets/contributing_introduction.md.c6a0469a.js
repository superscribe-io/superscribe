This means we need to be careful with any changes that might affect the stability, security, performance, or scalability of Directus. For this reason, it&#39;s important that any new feature is properly thought through and discussed before being implemented.</p><p>Before you start writing code to implement your new feature idea, please read through and understand our triaging process for new features before diving in.
