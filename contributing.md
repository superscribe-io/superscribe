# Contributing

Welcome to Superscribe!

Superscribe is a platform for automatic REST or GraphQL APIs on top of your database. It also comes with a full-featured admin application that you can use to manage your data, schema, metadata and permissions.

Superscribe is a community fork of Superscribe at the 9.26 branch, prior to the change to the BSL license.

The project is open to contributors! We welcome feedback, discussion and bug reports. Currently, PRs are restricted until we develop a CLA, but that should be changing soon - stay tuned. We need to make sure that all PRs and code contributions are assigning IP to the project so that they can all be released under the GPL v3. If you'd like to help with getting this in place, please let us know!

## Code of Conduct

## Ways to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

If you happen to run into a bug, please post an Issue on our main GitHub Issue board:
https://github.com/superscribe-io/superscribe/issues

Please be as explicit and detailed as you can in the bug report. The more information available, the easier it is for
other contributors to help you find the solution or fix. Consider adding a schema snapshot file, or a database dump.

### Leaving Feedback

If you have a great idea for an improvement of the platform, or any other feedback, please make sure to open a new
Discussion on our GitHub Discussions board: https://github.com/superscribe-io/superscribe/discussions

### Document the Project

The [Superscribe Docs](https://github.com/superscribe/docs) are living documents that can always be improved on. Notice any
parts of the docs in dire need of some tender love and care? Feel free to open a Pull Request!
